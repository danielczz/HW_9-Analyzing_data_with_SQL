## Project Outline

For business purposes usually we need to act quick on data. That is what we are doing in this particular exercise, the tools we are using to provide the analysis is _SQL_ as programming language and _MySQLWorkbench_ as programming tool. 

At the same time this is an analysis for an assigment related to Data Analytics Bootcamp. 

- Please review main SQL script for programming commands: 
[main SQL Script](https://github.com/danielczz/HW_9-Analyzing_data_with_SQL/blob/master/main_script_Analyzing_data_with_SQL.sql).


#### **1. Data gathering**
- Data we are currently using is related to film industry and customer DVD rental ecosystem analysis; SQL database is called _sakila_. 
- Reference: [Sakila DB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-history.html). 

#### **2. Data cleaning**
- Data is most of it already clean. 
- Some exercises will be to fine tuning some information in the Database. 

#### **3. Data analysis** 
- Using SQL grammmar we are generating most of the analysis.
- Reference:    [H2Database](http://www.h2database.com/html/grammar.html).

#### **4. Data conclusions** 

+ The top 5 films category for total amount are: 
    1. Sports:      _**$5314.21**_
    2. Sci-Fi:      _**$4756.98**_      
    3. Animation:  _**$4656.30**_
    4. Drama:       _**$4587.39**_
    5. Comedy:      _**$4383.58**_

2. The database contains information from 2 countries: _Canada and Australia_; It is a good starting point, but will be a more complete analysis with more information from different regions and business context.

3. The database has solid data from customers, such as first_name, last_name, emails, etc. This information is useful to start different business efforts (Marketing campaing, improve customer engagement,reduce customer churn, etc).
